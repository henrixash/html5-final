                <h1 class="title">Brief History</h1>
                <p>The creation of the College of Business and Economics (CBE) became official by virtue of BOR Resolution No.27, s.2010 on May 28, 2010. This milestone is a work of commitment by the Department of Agribusiness (BSAB) faculty members in 2008 under the leadership of Prof. Ruby C. Sansano who was then the BSAB Department Chair and became the first Dean of the CBE, Dr. Liberty G. Torres, the Dean of College of Agriculture and Dr. Marilou Gilo- Abon the University President. The team who invaluably contributed to the creation of CBE were Dr.Cristina R. Salvosa, Prof. Rachel Hope R. Tiongson, Prof Gayon P. Sarmiento, Ms Chery C. lacaden, Ms. Claire R. Reginalde, Mr. Josue Chua and mr. Jerson Solomon.</p>
                <p>The evolution of CBE started with two programs - the BS Agribusiness and the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA). The BSAB Program started as an offering under the College of Agriculture of the Nueva Vizcaya State Institute of Technology (now Nueva Vizcaya State University) by virtue of board of Trustees (BOT) Resolution No.20, s. 1985, which was first offered on the 1st Semester, SY 1985-1986. The Department of Agribusiness was created on the same year to manage the program and handle subjects in Economics, Management, Entrepreneurship and Accounting. The BSBA was first offered on the 1st semester of SY 2009-2010 chaired by Ms. Betty Ramos.</p>
                <p>In SY 2014-2015, the Graduate Programs were respectively transferred to various colleges, where CBE offered the Master in Management, Master in Public Administration, Master of Arts in Public Administration, and Doctor of Philosophy in Organizational Development and Planning. These programs were managed by Dr. Cristina R. Salvosa, the Graduate School (GS) Program Chair.</p>
                <p>In the 1st semester SY 2015-2016, Dr. Cristina R. Salvosa was selected to become the second Dean, who up to now actively leads CBE along with the respective department chairs for GS, BSBA and BSAB - Prof. Rachel Hope R. Tiongson, Dr. Dolores B. Galvez and Dr. Chery C. Lacaden.</p>
                <p>Recently, BSAB program has achieved Level III Re Accredited status by virtue of AACCUP Board Resolution No. 71 on November 5, 2016 while the BSBA program achieved Level II Re accredited Status on September 1, 2017. The Commission on Higher Education similarly issued Certificate of Compliance to both programs, COPC 030 and COPC 033 series of 2016, respectively.</p>
